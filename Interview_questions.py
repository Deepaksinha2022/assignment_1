# 5 interview question on data types

# Q1      - What are Data Types?
# Answer  - Data types are any set of values
#         - example - we have data types like int(2,54 etc), float(2.3,0.9 etc),complex(1+5j),list([1,48,-1])
#         - strings("a","hello"),set({4,56,"abc"}),dictionary({"a":2,"z":56}),tuple((5,8,9,4,23)) 


# Q2      - Name some of the main data types in Python 
# Answer  - Some of main data types in python are int,float,string,list,tuple,dictionary,set,complex,None Type,Bool type


# Q3      - Why are these data types known as Python’s core data types?
# Answer  - These data types are core because they serve as basis to deal with different types of data
#         - They are used to create objects,manupulate,write function among others

# Q4      - What does immutable mean and what three types of Python core data types are considered immutable?
# Answer  - Immutable means that it cannot be modified after its creation 
#         - Int,float,string,tuple are immutable datatypes

# Q5      - What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
# Answer  - A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types based on sequences


# 5 Questions on Operators

# Q1      - What are operators ?
# Answer  - Oparators are special symbols that are used to perform different operations

# Q2      - What are different types (with examples) of Operators in python ?
# Answer  - 1. Arithmetic Operator  -  +,-,*,/
#           2. Assignment Operator  -  =,+=,-=,/=
#           3. Comparison Operator  -  >,<,>=,<=
#           4. Logical Operator     -  or,and,not
#           5. Identity Operator    - is, isnot
#           6. Membership Operator  - in,not in

# Q3      - What is operator overloading ?
# Answer  - This feature  allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context.
#         - To overload the + operator, we can implement __add__() function in a class.


# Q4      - What is the difference between /, // ,% operators?
# Answer  - " / "  - it  gives the result in decimal and doesnot ignore the value after decimal
#         - "// "  - It ignore the value after decimal and returns tha floor value
#         - " % "  - It will return the remainder value after division

# Q5      - What are logical operators ?
# Answer  - and, or and not are the examples of logical operators


# 5 Questions on Conditional Statements

# Q1      - 1. What in “True” in Python?
# Answer  - Any expression that does not evaluate to 0

# Q2      - What are the three main conditional statements in Python?
# Answer  - if, elif, and else

# Q3      - Illustrate a basic if, elif, else structure.
# Answer  - if <condition>:
#         - . . .
#         - elif<another condition>:
#         - . . .
#         - else:
#         - . . .

# Q4      - What does elif mean?
# Answer  - it means else if. It is used after an if statement, to do another comparison.

# Q5      - How are if, elif, and else blocks defined?
# Answer  - All blocks in Python are defined by indenting. All lines of a particular code block must have the same level of indenting.




# 3 Questions on looping Statements

# Q1      - Which statement is used inside a loop to skip the rest of the code for the current iteration, so execution can continue with the next iteration?
# Answer  - continue

# Q2      - Which loop in Python is a counter-controlled loop?
# Answer  - In Python, for loop is a counter-controlled loop. The counter determines how many times the for loop executes

# Q3      - What does the break keyword do?
# Answer  -  Exits the loop immediately

# 2 Questions on Functions

# Q1      - What are the two types of functions in Python?
# Answer  - There are two types of functions in Python: built-in functions and user-defined functions.

# Q2      - Do Python functions have return values? If yes, then how many can they have?
# Answer  - Yes,They can have a single return value, or they can have multiple return values.
